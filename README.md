This repository holds some of the code I've developed specifically related to the ArcGIS Platform's Hub Sites. Scripts within the folders focus on designs using ESRI's Calcite Design System Web Components. You'll find various use cases of cards, buttons, accordions, steppers, etc. Use is restricted to those that follow the MIT License.
